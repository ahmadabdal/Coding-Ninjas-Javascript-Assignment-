Create a 'fibonacciSeries' function that takes a number N as a parameter and checks if it is a member of the Fibonacci series or not.
Return true if the number is a member of the Fibonacci series, else return false.
Fibonacci Series is defined by the recurrence

Solution:

// Write your code here:
function fibonacciSeries(n) {    
    var a = 0;
    var b = 1;
    var c;
    
    while(a < n){
        c = a+b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
    }
    
    console.log(a === n);
}
//call function
fibonacciSeries(5);
